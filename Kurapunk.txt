Running the program:

Via editor:
You need to make sure you are building to Windows in Build Settings. I have a windows machine so I developed with the Vivox Windows SDK.
I tried using the MacOS SDK so I can build for Mac, but I don't think it works if you use a windows machine.
The Vivox SDK for Windows is uploaded on git and in the package.zip file. Unpack that and drag into Assets/ folder.

Via game .exe file:
You need a Windows machine since I cannot build to MacOS because of the voice integration SDK situation explained above.
You can run the game by downloading the "KuraCyberpunk" zip folder. Unzip it and run "Kura Cyberpunk.exe".

After running the game:
You can read the story by left-clicking through it or skipping it by pressing escape.
It's a quick story I wrote for fun to make the environment feel more immersive! :D
On the "Join or Host a Lobby Page", make sure to enter your name and have one person click Host, the other hit Join.
If you want to Host, you need to enter a name and share your IP with the person joining (you don't need to enter your IP).
If you want to Join, you need to enter a name and the IP of the Host, then click Join.
Preferably, have the host player Host first, then have the second player Join in with the host's IP.
How to check LAN IP -> https://www.med.unc.edu/it/guide/operating-systems/how-do-i-find-the-host-name-ip-address-or-physical-address-of-my-machine/#:~:text=First%2C%20click%20on%20your%20Start,will%20be%20the%20IPv4%20address.

Since I didn't set up any servers and created this as P2P connection, you need to port forward if you want to connect over the internet.
The program uses port 7777. I'm happy to connect with you and test this out by port forwarding my own IP if you want.


Controls:
Here are some important controls you may need to know to properly check out everything I worked on.
It may take a bit of playing around to get comfortable with the player movement controls.

W,S: Movement (Foward[W] or Backward[S])
A,D: Rotate character (Right[D] or Left[A])
E,C: Rotate Camera (Look Up[E] or Look Down[C])
Scroll Wheel: FPS/3rd Person (ToggleFPS[ScrollUp] or Toggle3rdPerson[ScrollDown])
Q: Topdown View Environment
TAB: Toggle Settings Menu
Left[Shift]: Toggle 2D/3D Video
ESC: Quit Game

How Video and Voice are Integrated:
Video -> direct encoding of webcam texture to bytes and sent through Mirror protocols (I used TCP), then unpacked by other player
Mirror will not support a large number of users, but is effective for this task of connecting 2 people.
You can change your video resolution width (0-640), height (0,360), fps(0-50).
Please test with low resolution (around 160x190) and low FPS (around 5) if your machine is not powerful otherwise it may lag.
Voice Chat -> Used Vivox voice integration
